# coding-style-launcher
a little shell script to launch the epitech coding style checker

## How to use
* As a program:

Simply download the `cs.sh` file and move it tou your desired binary location

You can also copy these commands if you're lazy:

```
git clone https://github.com/Micka-DAOUD/coding-style-launcher.git
chmod +x 
sudo mv coding-style-launcher/cs.sh /usr/local/bin/
rm -rf coding-style-launcher/
```

* As a .bashrc function:

In case you don't want to directly add the file as a binary, you can create a shell function directly in your .bashrc file.

*note: this should also work in a .zshrc file or watever other shell you can use, however it hasn't been tested.*
